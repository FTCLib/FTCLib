/**
 * A robot subsystem.  Subsystems are the basic unit of robot organization in the Command-based
 * framework; they encapsulate low-level hardware objects (motor controllers, sensors, etc) and
 * provide methods through which they can be used by {@link Command}s.  Subsystems are used by the
 * {@link CommandScheduler}'s resource management system to ensure multiple robot actions are not
 * "fighting" over the same hardware; Commands that use a subsystem should include that subsystem
 * in their {@link Command#getRequirements()} method, and resources used within a subsystem should
 * generally remain encapsulated and not be shared by other parts of the robot.
 *
 * <p>Subsystems must be registered with the scheduler with the
 * {@link CommandScheduler#registerSubsystem(Subsystem...)} method in order for the
 * {@link Subsystem#periodic()} method to be called.  It is recommended that this method be called
 * from the constructor of users' Subsystem implementations.  The {@link SubsystemBase}
 * class offers a simple base for user implementations that handles this.
