# In Development: ftclib

Modeled off wpilib for FRC, the ftclib uses modularization and class dependencies
for easy robot programming. No need for multiple third-party libraries. Everything
can be found right here.

## DISCLAIMER! 
__Before using this project, please acknowledge that the FTCLib project is still in Alpha! That means that there are possibly bugs that exist in the code. The FTCLib library is continuing to grow, and part of that process is testing and fixing. By using this project, you except the risk of possible issues that exist in the library.__

This being said, FTCLib is a still in development, so bugs, exceptions, or errors are being fixed as the project progresses. Fixing bugs, exceptions, problems, and/or issues is a big priority for FTCLib, and your help would be greatly appreciated on that task. If you find an issue with FTCLib, please don't hesitate to contact us for a solution/workaround. Issues can be submitted through GitHub, or by email at `ftclib.release@gmail.com`.

While those two options are the most convenient for most things, another way it to contact one of our members through
the [FTC Discord](https://discord.gg/first-tech-challenge "The FTC Discord") .



## Alpha v1.0.0! (Dev Release)

This is the first official release of FTCLib! The project is still in the Alpha stage, with many things being untested. The project is being added to constantly, and there will most likely be smaller updates to come in the near future. If you want to contribute to the project, be sure to read the [Contributing.MD](https://github.com/Lunerwalker2/FTCLib-1/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md)

There is still a great need for Alpha testers, so also please contact us if you are interested in that.

## Installation

1. Open up your FTC SDK Project in Android Studio.

2. Go to your `build.common.gradle` file in your project.

    ![BuildCommonGradle](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV/blob/master/doc/images/build-common-gradle.png)
    
3. Add the following to the `repositories` section at the bottom of the file.

    ```groovy
   maven {
       url "https://ftclib.bintray.com/FTCLib" 
   }
   ```
    
4. Open the `build.gradle` file in your TeamCode module. 
    
    ![TeamCodeGradle](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV/blob/master/doc/images/teamcode-gradle.png)
    
5. Go to the bottom of the file, and add the following.

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        implementation `com.arcrobotics:ftclib:1.0.0`
    }
    ```
    
6. Perform a gradle sync to implement your changes.

    ![GradleSync](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV/blob/master/doc/images/gradle-sync.png)


7. When the sync finishes, you are done! You can now use FTCLib in your code.

__NOTE:__ If your module has a few dependencies, you might have an error related to multidex on building the project.
This is caused by the project exceeding the limit for imports enforced by Android Studio. To solve this, 
add `multiDexEnabled true` to the below location inside the `build.common.gradle` file.

```groovy

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId 'com.qualcomm.ftcrobotcontroller'
        minSdkVersion 19
        targetSdkVersion 26


        multiDexEnabled true
```

## Welcome to FTCLib!

Thank you for using the FTCLib library for your code! All of the people who worked on it have put a lot of effort into making FTCLib and amazing library. We thank you for putting our effort to work with your own projects. We hope you have great luck and success with your programming.

The mission of FTCLib is briefly summarized in the following quote made by Jackson from ARC Robotics, who started the library.


> Our goal is to make programming easier and more efficient through effective classes and detailed examples of implementation. - Jackson ARC Robotics

## Usage

For drivetrain kinematics, you can do:
```java
MecanumDrive dt = new MecanumDrive(motors);

x = gp1.joyLeft.x;
y = gp1.joyLeft.y;
turn = gp1.joyRight.x;

dt.driveRobotCentric(x, y, turn);
```
For a simple CV pipeline that aligns the robot with a skystone using a camera server:
```java
// create server
CameraServer cmr = new CameraServer("webcam");

// obtain server info for a certain instance
res = cmr.getInstance();

// if the skystone is not in range
while (!res.hasObject(VisualObject.SKYSTONE)) {
    robot.strafe(Safety.SWIFT, Direction.RIGHT);
    res = cmr.getInstance();
}
robot.stop(Safety.EASE_OFF)

// align robot with the skystone
robot.centerRobotWithObject(res.getObject(VisualObject.SKYSTONE));
```
If you want to have the robot switch to an automatic mode during teleop:
```java
// upon a button pressed on gamepad1
if (gp1.aButtonPressed()) {
    // end manual mode -> immediate seize of toolop commands
    robot.endManual();
    robot.forceReset(Safety.EASE_OFF); // stop the robot, but easily
    
    // set safety mode to determined default
    robot.setSafetyMode(Safety.DEFAULT);
    
    // cycle stones from human player
    robot.setAutoState(AutoState.CYCLE_STONES);
}
```
---
As you can see, FTC programming would be much more intuitive with the above systems.
All we have to do is add enough documentation so that even someone who has never programmed
in FTC before can write an incredible robot program in a relatively minimal amount of time.
