/**
 * This is a Vision Pipeline utilizing Contours and an Aspect Ratio to determine the number of rings
 * currently in the ring stack.
 *
 * @author Team 6133: The "NUTS"
 *
 * Explanation of algorithm:
 * Given an Mat of the current camera view, called input.
 *
 * We first take this Mat and convert it to YCrCb to help with thresholding.
 *
 * We then perform an inRange operation on the input Mat and store the result in a temporary
 * variable called mask. This mask is a black and white image where all white pixels on the mask
 * were pixels in input that are in the orange range threshold. All black pixels on the mask were
 * pixels in the input that were not in the orange range threshold.
 *
 * Next, using a GaussianBlur, we eliminate any noise between the rings on the stack. Due to how we
 * are thresholding in the mask calculation, there may be some gaps in the stack, due to shadows or
 * unwanted light sources.
 *
 * After the GaussianBlur, this noise is eliminated as the picture becomes "blurrier". We then find
 * all contours on the image.
 *
 * What is a Contour? Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points
 * (along the boundary), having same color or intensity. The contours are a useful tool for shape
 * analysis and object detection and recognition.
 *
 * After finding the contours on the black and white mask, we then perform a linear search algorithm
 * on the resulting list of contours (stored in as MatOfPoint). We first find the bounding rectangle
 * of each contour and use this bounding rectangle (not rotated) to find the rectangle with the
 * biggest width. We do this in order to not confuse the ring stack with other objects that may have
 * been thought to be orange by the mask. Since the ring stack will most likely be the largest blob
 * of orange in the view of the camera.
 *
 * When then do a check on the width of the widest contour. To see if it is actually a ring stack,
 * since zero is a valid option we must account for it. This check also makes sure that we don't
 * mistake other smaller objects on the field as the ring stack, even if they are rings.
 *
 * We also implemented a horizon check. Anything above the horizon is disregarded and not looked at
 * even if it has the greatest width from all the other contours. This is to ensure that the
 * algorithm down not detect the red goal as YCrCb color space is very unreliable when detecting the
 * difference between red and orange.
 *
 * After finding the widest contour, which is to be assumed the stack of rings, we perform an aspect
 * ratio of the height over the width of the largest bounding rectangle.
 *
 * Why not just count how tall the largest bounding rectangle is? It is because of camera resolution.
 * Since depending on the resolution of the camera, the height of the stack in pixels would be
 * different despite them both being 4 (lets say for example).
 *
 * Didn't you just say that you used a width check on the contour though? Isn't that also pixels?
 * Yes we did, however, unlike the height of the stack, the width of the stack is consistent. It is
 * always one ring wide, this way we are able to algorithmically generate a minimum bounding width.

 * @constructor Constructs the VisionPipeline
 *
 * @param telemetry If wanted, provide a telemetry object to the constructor to get stacktrace if an
 * error occurs (mainly for debug purposes)
 * @param debug If true, all intermediate calculation results (except showing mat operations) will
 * be printed to telemetry (mainly for debug purposes)
