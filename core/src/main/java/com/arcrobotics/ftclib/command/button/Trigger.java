 * This class provides an easy way to link commands to inputs.

 * <p>It is very easy to link a button to a command. For instance, you could link the trigger
 * button of a joystick to a "score" command.
 *
 * <p>It is encouraged that teams write a subclass of Trigger if they want to have something
 * unusual (for instance, if they want to react to the user holding a button while the robot is
 * reading a certain sensor input). For this, they only have to write the {@link Trigger#get()}
 * method to get the full functionality of the Trigger class.
